### Patch Changes

- 1ed1d25: `@aparte/provider-transformers` runs when it is served from another origin than the page — a CDN, or any deploy whose assets have their own host.

  Two walls stood between this provider and such a page, and each one hid the next.

  **The worker could not be constructed.** `new Worker()` refuses a cross-origin script outright, so the provider threw `SecurityError: Script at '…/assets/worker-*.js' cannot be accessed from origin '…'` at the first `prepareModel()`. It is not a CDN-only case: any app whose JavaScript is served from an asset host hits it, bundler or not. The worker is now started through a same-origin `blob:` whose whole body is one absolute import of the real file — a blob inherits the origin of the document that mints it, which is what makes it legal, and it is the same shim ffmpeg.wasm and tesseract.js use. Same-origin keeps the direct construction: no blob, nothing to revoke, and a stack trace that names the real file. The blob is released when the worker is terminated.

  **The worker could not resolve Transformers.js.** Its first line imported `@huggingface/transformers` by bare specifier, and an import map is the _document's_: by spec it does not reach a worker, so a page could map the specifier for itself and the worker still could not use it. The worker now resolves the module when it first needs it — `import('@huggingface/transformers')` first, which is statically visible so a bundler resolves and bundles the peer exactly as before, and failing that the absolute URL the main thread read out of the page's own import map (through `import.meta.resolve`, falling back to reading the map) and sent in the worker's first message.

  Nothing new is exported, and nothing changes for an app with a bundler. For a page without one, the import map it already needs to import `@aparte/core` by name is now also what tells the worker where Transformers.js lives — the version pin stays with you, which is what the peer dependency was for.

  One case remains impossible: a page whose Content-Security-Policy forbids `blob:` in `worker-src`/`script-src` cannot start a cross-origin worker at all, and the provider now says so by name instead of letting the browser's own message stand. Serve the package from your own origin there.

### Patch Changes

- c236992: Fixed: every package accepted a `@aparte/core` it cannot actually work with.

  All fourteen declared `"@aparte/core": ">=0.7.0 <1.0.0"` while sitting at 0.12.1 and
  importing symbols core does not export before 0.11.0 (`AparteElementAttributes`,
  `AparteTemplateAttrs`, `AparteElementTagName`) or before 0.12.0 (`AparteUiEventName`) —
  read from `src/index.ts` at each release tag, not inferred. npm and pnpm both ACCEPT
  `@aparte/react@0.12.1` beside `@aparte/core@0.7.0`, say nothing, and hand you a tree
  whose types cannot compile.

  These packages are published in lockstep and are never tested apart, so the floor is the
  release. It now says so, and `pnpm version-packages` moves it with every bump — the floor
  went stale because the bump was the one place nothing updated it.

### Minor Changes

- 688a231: Remediation of a from-scratch audit: four CRITICAL and nineteen MAJOR defects, plus the
  guards that make each class unrepeatable.

  **Fixes you will notice**

  - **Pressing Stop no longer erases the answer.** A stopped turn replaced everything
    already streamed with an error bubble, and never dispatched `aparte-message-aborted`.
    Three separate paths had to be closed: an abort arriving while the loop was parked on
    its read, `openai-compat` reporting an `AbortError` as a stream error where `ai-sdk`
    stays quiet, and a rejection escaping `transportCall` before the first event.
  - **A code fence split across deltas no longer eats the text before it**, and no longer
    leaks a literal ` ```python ` into the message.
  - **A split `<artifact` tag no longer loses its whole lifecycle.** `<` and `artifact` are
    separate tokens in most vocabularies, so whether artifact events fired depended on
    where the tokenizer cut.
  - **A turn the human stopped, stops.** A rejected tool no longer lets the rest of that
    turn's tool calls run.
  - **`compact()` only touches its own chat.** With two clients on a page, one event made
    both summarise the same conversation and wiped the other with no summary.
  - Retrying the first message no longer resends the whole conversation. Viewport listeners
    no longer accumulate when the element is moved in the DOM. A stream we walk away from
    is cancelled rather than left generating.

  **Breaking**

  - **A previewable artifact no longer runs the model's code without a user gesture.** The
    card opened on Preview with the frame already mounted, so every render of a completed
    artifact — including reloading a persisted conversation — executed model-authored JS.
    It is sandboxed, so this was a prompt-injection surface rather than origin XSS. The
    frame is now created only when the user presses Preview, and is CSP-constrained. An app
    that wants it open must open the tab itself.
  - **`authorize` is required on `createAparteChatHandler`.** The endpoint spends your
    server-held key, and both the JSDoc example and the docs snippet omitted it — the
    copy-paste path was the unauthenticated one. `authorize: () => true` still works, but
    now someone wrote it on purpose. Vendor error bodies are summarised instead of relayed,
    because an OpenAI 401 hands the caller your key's prefix and tail.
  - **`streamRunner: runStreamAgent` finally typechecks.** Making it compile required
    narrowing `role`, mirroring the content-part union and the tool types, declaring
    `modelId`, and removing three index signatures from `@aparte/engine`'s mirror types. A
    consumer who wrote their own `StreamAgentMessage` may need to adjust.
  - `@aparte/engine` no longer re-exports `deriveArtifactKind` — it collided with
    `@aparte/core`'s export of the same name, with a different function behind it.
  - `escapeHtml` / `escapeAttr`, `AparteHostHandlersConfig` and `AparteKeyProvider` are now
    exported from `@aparte/core`.
  - **Ten exports are renamed**, before 1.0 makes their names permanent. The four classes
    gain the prefix every other class already carried, and the six shared defaults gain a
    namespace so they cannot collide with an app's own:

    | before                       | after                               |
    | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
    | `DirectTransport`            | `AparteDirectTransport`             |
    | `BackendTransport`           | `AparteBackendTransport`            |
    | `MessageRepository`          | `AparteMessageRepository`           |
    | `ConversationManager`        | `AparteConversationManager`         |
    | `DEFAULT_LOCALE`             | `APARTE_DEFAULT_LOCALE`             |
    | `DEFAULT_UI_EVENTS`          | `APARTE_DEFAULT_UI_EVENTS`          |
    | `DEFAULT_ICON_FALLBACKS`     | `APARTE_DEFAULT_ICON_FALLBACKS`     |
    | `DEFAULT_BUBBLE_ACTIONS`     | `APARTE_DEFAULT_BUBBLE_ACTIONS`     |
    | `DEFAULT_HOST_HANDLERS`      | `APARTE_DEFAULT_HOST_HANDLERS`      |
    | `DEFAULT_SKELETON_FALLBACKS` | `APARTE_DEFAULT_SKELETON_FALLBACKS` |

    Functions keep their verb names — `registerDefaultRenderers`, `contentToText`,
    `filesToAttachments` and the rest are unchanged, because prefixing a verb reads worse
    than the inconsistency it would fix.

  - **The config naming is inverted: `AparteConfig` is now the class, and the page-wide
    instance is `aparteGlobalConfig`.** `AparteConfigClass` is gone.

    ```diff
    - import { AparteConfig, type AparteConfigClass } from '@aparte/core';
    - AparteConfig.setMarkdownProvider(provider);
    - function configure(config: AparteConfigClass) {}
    + import { aparteGlobalConfig, type AparteConfig } from '@aparte/core';
    + aparteGlobalConfig.setMarkdownProvider(provider);
    + function configure(config: AparteConfig) {}
    ```

    One `sed` covers a whole consumer, and the order matters — run the instance first, so
    that `\bAparteConfig\b` cannot yet match the class:

    ```bash
    # 1. the instance, then 2. the class. Never the reverse.
    grep -rlE '\bAparteConfig(Class)?\b' src \
      | xargs perl -pi -e 's/\bAparteConfig\b/aparteGlobalConfig/g'
    grep -rl 'AparteConfigClass' src \
      | xargs perl -pi -e 's/\bAparteConfigClass\b/AparteConfig/g'
    ```

    It rewrites string literals too, so a log prefix of your own like `[AparteConfig]`
    becomes `[aparteGlobalConfig]` — harmless, but check your diff if you grep your logs.

    Two reasons this happens now rather than never. `AparteConfigClass` was not a name, it
    was an admission — the `Class` suffix existed only because the good name was taken by an
    object, and PascalCase means constructor everywhere else in the ecosystem, so
    `AparteConfig.setMarkdownProvider(...)` read as a static method to every reader. And the
    library moved under it: since config became per-instance, the global singleton is one
    config among several and the one we recommend least. Giving it the canonical name
    pointed at the case we want people to outgrow; `aparteGlobalConfig` says at every call
    site which config you are touching.

  - **`@aparte/provider-transformers`: `terminateWorker()` no longer bricks the provider.**
    Called while a generate was in flight, it dropped the pending streams but left their
    serialization slots unresolved — so the next `chat()` awaited a promise that could never
    settle. No error, no rejection: the stream simply never started again, for the life of
    the page. The worker-error path already released those slots, with a comment explaining
    why; `terminateWorker`, 240 lines below it, did not.

    Its state is still **tab-scoped, on purpose**, and now says so: one worker, one loaded
    model, one generate at a time, with `setComputeDevice` / `setMaxCachedModels` /
    `setHardwareTierModels` applying page-wide. A local model is 1–2 GB of weights and one
    WebGPU pipeline, so a worker per chat would mean N copies resident in one tab — the
    failure this package exists to avoid. Two chats on the same model share the load, which
    is the case it is for. Two chats on _different_ models serialize and, at the default
    budget of one cached model, can evict and reload gigabytes between turns — that used to
    happen in silence and now warns once, naming both models.

    `TransformersProvider.chat` is also declared non-optional now, so consumers stop needing
    `provider.chat!(...)`.

  - **Seven documented event contracts are gone, because those events never existed.**
    Not "undocumented" — the name appeared in the repo only in its own declaration.
    `aparte-artifact-open` sat in the event map with a detail type asserting it is
    "dispatched by the artifact pill when a user clicks it"; three hits repo-wide, all
    three its own declaration.

    | removed                             | why                                                                                                             |
    | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `AparteTokenEventDetail`            | `aparte-token` is dispatched nowhere                                                                            |
    | `AparteMessageEventDetail`          | `aparte-message` is dispatched nowhere                                                                          |
    | `AparteStatusEventDetail`           | `aparte-status` is dispatched nowhere                                                                           |
    | `AparteToolActionDetail`            | its JSDoc names `aparte-tool-action`, which does not exist                                                      |
    | `AparteSegmentActionEvent`          | `aparte-segment-action` does not exist                                                                          |
    | `AparteConversationUnarchiveDetail` | a dead type on a live event — the dispatcher types both archive branches with `AparteConversationArchiveDetail` |

    Two were renamed rather than deleted, because their shape was right and only the
    event they named was wrong:

    ```diff
    - import type { AparteArtifactOpenEventDetail, AparteSegmentUpdateEvent } from '@aparte/core';
    + import type { AparteArtifactRedownloadEventDetail, AparteSegmentUpdateEventDetail } from '@aparte/core';
    ```

    `AparteArtifactRedownloadEventDetail` is field-for-field what the Download button
    really dispatches. `AparteSegmentUpdateEventDetail` was a detail, not an event, and
    had never reached a package entry point at all — so you could bind an event listed
    in the published API table and never name its detail. Same for
    `AparteConversationArchiveDetail`, now exported.

  - **Twenty events gained a typed `detail`, so the cast the docs promised you would
    never write is finally unnecessary.** The map carried 17 entries against 37 events
    that dispatch a detail. Fourteen had no declared type anywhere — including
    `aparte-file-gen-ready` / `-error`, where core renders a "Running sandbox…" card and
    waits on `window` for an event nothing in the library emits, so a consumer had to
    reverse-engineer six fields from an inline cast to make a binary artifact ever
    finish. Six more had a public detail type and still forced a cast at every listener.

    Additive for your code, and `check:event-map` now enforces both directions: an event
    with a detail must be in the map, and a map entry must correspond to a real event.

  - **`AparteThemeVariables` is `{ [K in `--aparte-${string}`]?: string }`.** It was a
    hand-written list of 33 CSS properties, ten of which are neither declared nor read
    anywhere in aparté — so it autocompleted ten knobs that do nothing — while the real
    surface is 254 tokens. You lose autocomplete and gain a type that cannot lie; the
    231 tokens the old list omitted, the whole `aparte-select` surface included, now
    typecheck. The discoverable list is the generated CSS-variables reference.

  - **One name for the imperative surface: `AparteChatImperativeApi`.** React exported it
    as `AparteChatHandle`, Vue and Svelte as `AparteChatInstance`, and Angular exposed no
    name at all — one contract wearing three names in a suite that publishes all four
    together in lockstep. Both aliases are gone; every wrapper now re-exports the canonical
    type straight from `@aparte/core`, which is also where its documentation lives, so the
    names cannot drift again.

    ```diff
    - import { AparteChat, useAparteChat, type AparteChatHandle } from '@aparte/react';
    + import { AparteChat, useAparteChat, type AparteChatImperativeApi } from '@aparte/react';
    ```

    Same rename for `AparteChatInstance` in `@aparte/vue` and `@aparte/svelte`. Nothing
    about the shape changed — it was already an alias of the same type in all three.

  - **`AparteAIProvider` is a union instead of one permissive interface.** It had three
    required members and fifteen optional ones, holding two mutually sufficient execution
    surfaces — a `chat()` that owns its own I/O, or the format-adapter surface a transport
    drives — discriminated at **runtime** by `isFormatAdapter()`. So
    `{ id, getMetadata, getModels }` typechecked, registered without a word, and failed on
    the first message. A half-built adapter (`buildRequest` but no `parseStream`) did the
    same, and so did a complete adapter with no way to present a key.

    Now the compiler answers "which half did you implement?". Every member of both
    surfaces stays reachable on the union — optional on the arm that does not require it —
    so `typeof p.buildRequest === 'function'` probes and `isFormatAdapter()` narrowing are
    unchanged, and a provider implementing both surfaces is still valid. If your provider
    was complete it compiles as before; if it was one of the shapes above, it never worked.

  - **Every satellite's peer on `@aparte/core` is now the lockstep range** (`~0.8.0`)
    instead of `>=0.5.0-alpha.0 <1.0.0`. The suite has always published in lockstep, so
    that range described a compatibility promise nobody was making or testing: npm was
    happy to install `@aparte/react@0.8.0` beside `@aparte/core@0.5.0`, and the failure
    landed at runtime with no warning at install. This very release makes the point —
    under the old range, `@aparte/react@0.8.0` would install against `@aparte/core@0.7.1`
    and then fail on an `aparteGlobalConfig` that does not exist there.

    If you install the packages together, or with `latest`, nothing changes. If you were
    pinning `@aparte/core` behind the wrappers, npm now tells you at install time instead
    of at first render.

  - `@aparte/svelte` ships its `.svelte` sources instead of a precompiled bundle, and
    supports Svelte 4 **and** 5 (`^4.0.0 || ^5.0.0`). Nothing to change in your code, unless
    you were importing from a deep path inside `dist`.
  - Every plugin `setup*` takes an optional trailing `config`, so a plugin can be scoped to
    one chat instead of the global singleton. Existing calls are unaffected.
  - `AparteClient` accepts `toolTimeoutMs`, matching `runStreamAgent`'s option of the same
    name — it was previously a hard-coded constant, so setting it worked on one loop only.

  **Security**

  Nine private copies of the HTML-escaping helper became one; three of them had drifted to
  leave the apostrophe through, which is enough to break out of a single-quoted attribute.
  42 unescaped attribute interpolations were swept (the audit reported 3). Segment lookups
  are scoped to their own children, so a decoy `data-segment-id` in model markdown can no
  longer hijack a human-in-the-loop control. A style declaration containing a backslash is
  rejected outright, and a `data:` image URL must name its subtype.

  `srcset` now goes through the same URL allowlist as `src`. It had only a
  `javascript:`/`vbscript:` substring test, so `srcset="data:text/html,<script>..." `
  passed untouched while the identical URL on `src` was rejected — one allowlist giving
  two answers depending on which attribute carried the URL. Each scheme in the value is
  validated rather than splitting on commas, because a legitimate base64 `data:` URL
  contains one.

  `data:image/svg+xml` is deliberately KEPT in the allowlist, contrary to an earlier plan
  to drop it: inside an `<img>` a data-URL SVG is secure-static in every engine (no
  scripts, no external fetches), and removing it would break a model emitting an inline
  chart. What it must not do is travel — an app that moves such a URL into an `<object>`,
  `<embed>` or an iframe leaves secure-static mode, and that constraint belongs to
  whoever re-hosts it.

  **Also in this release**

  - **Elicitation stops inventing refusals.** With no presenter registered,
    `requestUserInput()` resolved `{ action: 'cancel' }` in silence: your tool reported a
    refusal the user was never asked for, and the model answered as though they had
    declined. It still resolves `cancel` (a question nobody can render cannot be awaited)
    but now warns once, and the guide shows the `<aparte-elicitation>` element you must
    place — it registers itself on connect, so nothing happens until it is in your markup.
  - **`@aparte/svelte` publishes resolvable types.** `types` was not first in its
    `exports` block, and export conditions are order-sensitive, so TypeScript could not
    resolve the package's types at all. The `svelte` condition now carries its own `types`,
    matching how core's `node` condition is built.
  - `escapeHtml` / `escapeAttr` / `cssEscape` are documented with an example instead of
    being mentioned in passing: which one belongs in markup, which in an attribute, which
    in a selector, and why the apostrophe matters. They were exported all along while a
    comment in their own file claimed they were internal.
  - `AparteClientOptions.toolTimeoutMs` is in the config reference. The `config` argument
    every plugin `setup*` takes is documented with an example — it was named nowhere, and
    it is what lets two chats on one page use different providers.

  - **Segment renderers are per config too, so the `config` prop is now honest end to
    end.** `registerSegmentRenderer`, `unregisterSegmentRenderer`, `getSegmentRenderer`,
    `getAllRenderers`, `collectRendererStyles`, `registerDefaultRenderers` and
    `declineDefaultRenderers` all take an optional trailing config; omitted, they act on
    the ambient or global one exactly as before, so no existing call changes.

    This was the other half of the wrappers' promise. A plugin's providers were already
    scoped, but the registry deciding WHICH renderer draws a segment was a module-level
    Map — two chats on a page shared their segment renderers whatever config they were
    given. `AparteClient({ config, autoRegister: false })` was affected the same way: it
    declined the built-ins on the global config rather than on its own, muting the wrong
    chat.

  - `thinkingDelimiters` is documented, including the two pairs recognised by default and
    the fact that only the bring-your-own-loop path can reach it.

  **A Safari bug the new browser suite found, and closed**

  In framework mode — what every React / Vue / Svelte / Angular consumer runs — a streamed
  transcript settled a deterministic 31px short of the bottom on Safari and stayed there,
  so the last line of a reply sat under the fold. A timeline of a streamed turn showed the
  content settling in TWO layout passes (1118 → 1121 → 1152 px): `scrollTop = scrollHeight`
  ran against the middle one and nothing ran again afterwards. Auto-follow was armed the
  whole time — the viewport was not disarmed, it was satisfied, because "am I at the
  bottom?" is answered with a 50px tolerance that is right for keeping auto-follow armed
  and wrong as a definition of anchored.

  Fixed by a bounded re-check over the next few frames, which stops as soon as the gap is
  closed and re-reads the auto-follow flag every frame so a reader who scrolls away
  mid-settle is left alone. It exists only because a browser test drove a real progressive
  stream through a real engine; no unit test could see it, and the suite that shipped before
  this release delivered every reply atomically.

- 8286e3f: Two provider contracts now say what they actually do.

  `createOpenAICompatProvider` returns `AparteAIProvider & AparteFormatAdapter`. The
  factory has always supplied `buildRequest` / `parseStream` / `authHeaders` /
  `defaultEndpoint`, but the declared type left them optional (right for
  `AparteAIProvider` in general, since a provider may own its I/O through `chat()`) —
  so callers driving the adapter themselves had to add `!` or write a check that
  cannot fail.

  `@aparte/provider-transformers` warns once when it drops `tool_call` / `tool_result`
  turns from the prompt. Tool calling is out of scope for v1, but the turns were
  filtered silently: an app with registered tools got a model that never saw the call
  or its result, with nothing to explain it.
